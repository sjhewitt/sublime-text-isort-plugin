Possible Issues with :func:`~natsort.humansorted` or ``ns.LOCALE``
==================================================================

Being Locale-Aware Means Both Numbers and Non-Numbers
-----------------------------------------------------

In addition modifying how characters are sorted, ``ns.LOCALE`` will take into
account locale-dependent thousands separators (and locale-dependent decimal
separators if ``ns.FLOAT`` is enabled). This means that if you are in a
locale that uses commas as the thousands separator, a number like
``123,456`` will be interpreted as ``123456``.  If this is not what you want,
you may consider using ``ns.LOCALEALPHA`` which will only enable locale-aware
sorting for non-numbers (similarly, ``ns.LOCALENUM`` enables locale-aware
sorting only for numbers).

Regenerate Key With :func:`~natsort.natsort_keygen` After Changing Locale
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When :func:`~natsort.natsort_keygen` is called it returns a key function that
hard-codes the provided settings. This means that the key returned when
``ns.LOCALE`` is used contins the settings specifed by the locale
`loaded at the time the key is generated`. If you change the locale,
you should regenerate the key to account for the new locale.

Corollary: Do Not Reuse :func:`~natsort.natsort_keygen` After Changing Locale
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you change locale, the old function will not work as expected.
The `locale <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/locale.html>`_ library works
with a global state. When :func:`~natsort.natsort_keygen` is called it does the
best job that it can to make the returned function as static as possible and
independent of the global state, but the 
`strxfrm <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/locale.html#locale.strxfrm>`_
function must access this global state to work; therefore, if you change
locale and use ``ns.LOCALE`` then you should discard the old key.

.. note:: If you use `PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ then you
          may be able to reuse keys after changing locale.

The `locale <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/locale.html>`_ Module From the StdLib Has Issues
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:mod:`natsort` will use `PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ for
:func:`~natsort.humansorted` or ``ns.LOCALE`` if it is installed. If not,
it will fall back on the `locale <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/locale.html>`_
library from the Python stdlib. If you do not have
`PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ installed, please keep the
following known problems and issues in mind.

.. note:: Remember, if you have `PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_
          installed you shouldn't need to worry about any of these.

Explicitly Set the Locale Before Using :func:`~natsort.humansorted` or ``ns.LOCALE``
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have found that unless you explicitly set a locale, the sorted order may not
be what you expect. Setting this is straightforward
(in the below example I use 'en_US.UTF-8', but you should use your
locale)::

    >>> import locale
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8')
    'en_US.UTF-8'

.. _bug_note:

`locale <https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/locale.html>`_ Is Broken on Mac OS X
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

It's not Python's fault, but the OS... the locale library for BSD-based systems
(of which Mac OS X is one) is broken. See the following links:

  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3412933/python-not-sorting-unicode-properly-strcoll-doesnt-help
  - http://bugs.python.org/issue23195
  - https://github.com/SethMMorton/natsort/issues/21 (contains instructons on installing)
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33459384/unicode-character-not-in-range-when-calling-locale-strxfrm
  - https://github.com/SethMMorton/natsort/issues/34

Of course, installing `PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ fixes this,
but if you don't want to or cannot install this there is some hope.

    1. As of ``natsort`` version 4.0.0, ``natsort`` is configured
       to compensate for a broken ``locale`` library. When sorting non-numbers
       it will handle case as you expect, but it will still not be able to
       comprehend non-ASCII characters properly. Additionally, it has
       a built-in lookup table of thousands separators that are incorrect
       on OS X/BSD (but is possible it is not complete... please file an
       issue if you see it is not complete)
    2. Use "\*.ISO8859-1" locale (i.e. 'en_US.ISO8859-1') rather than "\*.UTF-8"
       locale. I have found that these have fewer issues than "UTF-8", but
       your mileage may vary.
